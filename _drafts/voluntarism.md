There are two ways to get things in life, through free markets or through political coercion.  Most of us secure our food, shelter, clothing, and most other
goods through the market on an entirely nonviolent basis.  Over the years competition has increased the quality and variety of goods and services while lowering the cost.  

The one area where there are no free-market solutions is the provision of justice.  We all want it but more often than not people fall back on the political means of securing it.  People talk about revolution, protests, lobbying, emailing, and begging those in power to give us our liberties.    Unfortunately, these efforts often ask individuals to sacrifice their time, money, and effort for the benefit of ‘all’.   Any liberty and justice secured through violence or politics will ultimately continue to operate via violence and politics.

Libertarians have long theorized about how a free society would provide police, courts, and justice without the initiation of force and violence against the innocent.  The book <a href=”https://mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf”>”The Market for Liberty”</a> goes into great detail about how this might work.   Murray Rothbard first gave a talk about <a href=”society-without-a-state”>”Society without a State”</a> all the way back in 1975.   Despite all of this theory, there was an underlying assumption that the state must give up power before any of these systems could be realized.  The other subtle assumption is that some violence may be necessary and used against criminals found guilty by the market.

Here at The iLand Nation we realized that a free-market solution to securing our life, liberty, and property would have to be capable of defending against governments.  Only a system able to defeat governments would have any staying power.  A consequence of this reality is that a free market solution to justice must be entirely nonviolent, rely entirely on voluntary association and voluntary compliance.   The system would have to be entirely ‘legal’ under existing governments and be extremely difficult to ‘outlaw’.

The iLand is a new free market solution that aims to secure life, liberty, and property for its members.  The key ingredients to this solution include:

Individuals publicly commit to abide by their own standard of law.
Individuals publicly commit to arbitrate via one or more courts of their own choosing.
Individuals deposit a security bond with one or more trusted agencies. 
Individuals share the burden of injustice by contributing to a common fund.
Individuals shun anyone whom fails to arbitrate or abide by the outcome.

In the event two individuals do not agree on a common arbitration agency, their case is is tried by two courts (one accepted by each party).  If there is a disagreement between the courts then the courts must arbitrate the result.  If a court refuses to arbitrate then it is shunned. 

The end result of this system as that iLanders now know who has agreed to an acceptable standard of law, who hasn’t, and who is a criminal.  They can rest assured that by associating with fellow iLanders that any dispute can be resolved quickly and any award can be collected via their security bond or via the injustice sharing fund.

Overcoming Government 

Not everyone has to join The iLand to be brought to justice.  The fact of the matter is that anyone who benefits from the right of legal plunder backed by government courts is unlikely to agree to arbitration nor comply with an arbitration award issued when they fail to appear.

There are three ways that iLanders deal with ‘legal plunder’ that become more effective as the community grows.  

Focus on Individuals Responsible 
Public Shaming 
Coordinated Shunning

Focus on Individuals Responsible
Companies, Organizations, and Governments are masks that people hide behind to escape responsibility for their actions.  You cannot have a dispute with a company, a company cannot ‘decide’ anything, and a company cannot violate your rights.   Only people can do these things.    

Instead of inviting ‘The Federal Government’ to attend arbitration and issuing a judgment against ‘The Federal Government’, iLanders must identify the individuals in government responsible for their particular injustice.   

If a police officer violates your rights, you bring him into arbitration.  ‘Just doing my job’ is not an acceptable defense nor does it relieve him of his obligation.    If a Federal Judge makes an unjust ruling against you then you bring him and the prosecutor in for arbitration and get judgements against them and demand they pay restitution.

The consequence of this is that anyone who voluntarily helps the government enforce unjust laws, regulations, and taxes becomes subject of public shame and liable for their actions.  As iLanders grow in number and impact of being systematically shunned by the honest people in society becomes greater, governments will be unable to find anyone willing to work for them.

Conclusion
I truly believe that most people would love an opportunity to select their own laws and be judged by their own courts.  Most people hate expensive lawyers, legalese, and legal  technicalities.   Most people want to avoid conflict and violence.  Most people want to be
made whole when someone wrongs them.   Because of this I truly believe that most of society will eventually want to participate in this system, especially as government violations of individual rights grows. 

Ultimately, the free market will find all of the solutions and overcome those who wish to use violence to get what they want.
