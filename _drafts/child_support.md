A Libertarian take on Child Support and Custody

There are few things that can cause one to lose their mental clarity more than issues involving children.  After scouring the internet I was unable to find many libertarian takes on the issue of child support and custody.   Millions of otherwise decent individuals find themselves in court fighting to either increase or decrease the amount of support owed.  Many men intuitively know that something isn’t right;  other men have throughly bought into the concept and feel it is their duty and pay support to avoid the shame and guilt of not ‘supporting’ their kids.  

The reality is that most men (and women) don’t know how to take a principled stand against child support and are afraid to speak up for fear of being labeled a ‘deadbeat‘, ‘child hater’, or ‘irresponsible’.    The purpose of this article is to help remove any guilt associated with “not paying” or “not wanting to pay” and to cause those who demand payment to question who has the “moral high ground”.   I believe that removing this guilt is the first step toward helping eliminate this kind of abuse.

What follows is what I consider a logical application of libertarian theory, property rights, and the non-aggression principle to the the topic of Child Support and Custody.  

What is Child Support?

Child Support is a transfer payment from one parent to another parent.  The justification for such a payment is a combination of logical fallacies such as:

	A) It is ‘in the best interest’ of the child.
	A)	Regardless of custody, both parents have a moral duty to support the child.
	B)	Custody is a burden
	C)	A child deserves an ‘equal’ standard of living at both homes.
	D)	A child is the property of the State
	E)	50/ 50 Responsibility

Child Support is a kind of ‘reverse Social Security’ where the government decides how much money should be transferred from one generation to the next.   The primary difference being is that instead of a national obligation to care for old geezers, child support is an individual obligation.   While deadbeat kids don’t face jail time for failure to care for their parents, ‘deadbeat parents’ face jail time if they do not pay the custodial parent of their child.  

Is Child Support fair?

Sometimes it is easier to gain clarity on sensitive and highly emotional issues by using an analogy.   For the sake of simplicity I will assume the normal case, both parents chose to have the child and both want custody of their kids.  I will address other situations later. But first, I need to establish some basic assumptions which form the foundation of my reasoning:

	1)	 If custody was a net-burden then the parents would not have chosen to have kids.  Clearly the choice to have kids reveals that they value the opportunity to raise a child more than the cost to raise a child.
	2)	A couple has a right to give their children up for adoption. 

Now that my assumptions are on the table, lets begin my analogy.  A man and wife decide they want to build a dream house together.  To reach their goal the man and wife take on a 18 year new-construction loan.  The woman has a better sense of style and cares for the home on a day to day basis, while the man has a better sense of engineering and an ability to earn the income necessary to cover the loan.   Together they both contribute to providing an structurally sound, stylish, well-kept home that they can both enjoy.

Then, 5 years into this agreement, the man and wife decide to divorce.  They go before a judge and ask for a division of assets and liabilities.  The judge looks at the situation and orders as follows:

	1)	The woman gets to live in the house.
	2)	The man and woman ‘split‘ the mortgage bill proportional to their income.
	3)	The man and woman ‘split‘ the home owners insurance proportional to their income.
	4)	If the man’s income goes up the woman is entitled to take on a home equity loan and they will split payments proportional to their income.
	5)	The woman has sole discretion on how the home equity loan is used.
	6)	The man is allowed to visit the home every other weekend and vacation there a couple of weeks per year.

The justification for this decision would be as follows:

	1)	It is in the best interest of the home’s value, because a woman keeps it cleaner. 
	2)	Both parties have a moral obligation to pay the mortgage. 
	3)	The house is the property of the State and failure to maintain it at pre-divorce levels would negatively affect property values and tax revenues.
	4)	It would be a burden on society to provide housing for a woman who could not afford it on her own.

In reality what a judge would probably do in this situation would be to make the party who gets to keep the house liable for the loan and make them pay 50% of any equity in the home to the person who lost the house.

If this were a child support case, this would mean the custodial parent would end up paying the non-custodial parent because we have already established that custody is of greater value than the ‘burden’ or liability of raising a child.

What about the best interest of the child?

At this point many people will object that a child has an interest in the outcome and that the child’s interest is even greater than the parents.   After all, a child is a person and not ‘property’ like a house.   

Assuming the child’s parents had remained married what level of ‘support’ or ‘standard of living’ is the child entitled to and whom gets to decide?   Do the parents have a right to become missionaries and live at the poverty level?   If the parents are millionaires does the child have a right to an allowance?    If the parents could afford a bigger home, does a child have a right to demand it?  If the parents choose to quit their high-paying job to work for a charity does the child have a right to demand the same standard of living?

I think it is fair to say that a child is entirely dependent upon the generosity of their caretakers and while they may benefit from this generosity and therefore be interested in the source of the generosity, they are not entitled to it.

No judge would allow a rich couple to steal custody of a child from a poor couple simply because of ‘best interest’ arguments.   Likewise, no poor couple should be able to steal custody of a child from a rich couple simply because they have more time for the child and the rich couple works all of the time.  All of these ideas are obviously crazy.

Who gets to decide the best interest of the child: Mom, Dad, the child, or the State?   If the child were old enough they would be the only ones fully qualified to make the decision and bear the consequences of that decision.   If the child were too young the mom and dad are in the best position and have the most interest and love for the child.    Unfortunately, we already know what happens.  Mom and dad disagree about what is best for the kid.  In fact, mom and dad often mix in their own best interests with those of their child.   If mom and dad are not immune from mixing their interests with those of the child, why should we think anyone else, especially the state, would be immune?

With the state as the decider of ‘best interest’, any parent who takes non-conformist views on anything from government schooling, fluoride, vaccination, the pledge of allegiance, political philosophy, drug laws, guns, taxes, alternative medicine or any other topic of relevance to the government or the individual judge will be automatically biased against.   The judge will favor the parent they agree with ‘most‘ and consider the other parent ‘irresponsible’ or ‘dangerous‘ and no judge is likely to entertain a full scientific inquiry into all of those non-conformist positions.    

Another factor biasing the judicial system and guidelines judges are supposed to follow is that state governments get federal kickbacks for child support payments.  It is therefore in the governments interest to award custody to the lower-income parent.   It is also in the government’s interest to impute income to a parent.  If a high earning business man decides his job is too stressful and wishes to switch to a career of homesteading with very low income then the State would lose tax revenue.  By imputing income, and thereby raising child support, the State will gain tax revenues.   

What can we conclude about ‘best interest of the child’?   That it really a euphemism for ‘best interest of the State’ and cannot be determined by any third party other than by mutual agreement of both parents.   In only a decision by private arbitrators voluntarily chosen by both parents could be said to factor in the best interest of the child as the arbitrator would have the delegated authority of both parents.

A just Solution to Custody and Child Support  
  
Because all value is relative, we cannot assign a numerical value on retaining custody nor is there an absolute measure of the liability.  But we do not need to objectively measure these values to properly weigh them on the scales of justice.   Both parties have by their past decision to have children as well as their current desire to win custody confessed that they value custody more than the liability (unless their desire for custody is based upon their financial interest in child support payments).  The proof is that in the absence of child support, most parents would still prefer to have custody. Therefore, the only just decision that a court can order is 50/50 custody and no child support as each parent would have liability for all expenses while the child is in their care.

       Unfortunately, 50/50 custody is not always practical (due to distance or financial stability of the parents).   In this situation there are four cases:

        1) Both parents desire and are able to provide more than 50% of the care.
	2) One parent is unable to care for their children 50% of the time.
 	3) One parent does not want 50% custody.
	4) Neither parent wants 50% custody.

	In the first case, neither parent has a right to deny the other their right to 50% custody; therefore, they must reach an agreement where the custodial parent pays the non-custodial parent for the privilege of having greater than 50% custody.  No court has a right to 'price fix' this amount, it must be voluntary or the result is theft of value from one party for the benefit of the other.

	In the second case, the non custodial parent would simply be grateful to be free of the burden and the custodial parent would be grateful for the additional custody.  The non-custodial parent would be motivated to work hard to be able to afford to care for their children and therefore reap the benefits of their right to 50% custody.  If they are really successful they may be able to negotiate greater than 50% custody (case 1)

	In the third case, there is no dispute over custody, end-of-story.  

	In the fourth case the parents should give the kid up for adoption or reach a voluntary agreement where one parent pays the other child support to offset the 'negative value' they associate with having custody.   In effect, the courts today impute a net-negative value on having custody in order to justify child support.

	In some cases the father may opt to hire the mother to provide care for his children rather than hire a day care provider.  In this case, it would have the appearance of child support but because of the voluntary nature of the transaction it is still fair and just.

Deadbeat Dads or Deadbeat Moms?
	
	Given the analyst above lets reconsider the derogatory labels applied to anyone whom is against child support.   These dads have lost custody of their children to moms whom wanted custody.   They have had significant value and experience stripped from their life and have been enslaved to the mother of their child who now demands 25-50% of their income and forbids the dad from taking a lower income job.  They work hard, and take on a second job just to survive.  The mother then gets 25% to 50% of the second job’s income as well and yet they are considered ‘deadbeat’?   More like ‘beat-dead’ dads.

	It seems to me that the real deadbeats are the moms who are enjoying the benefits of custody and supplemental child support income and whom did not have to work for it.  They are unable to provide their standard of living on their own and are effectively welfare queens.  

Don’t become a Victim 
	
	By this point I can see most of the child-support paying dads nodding their heads and realizing that they are a victim of significant theft and violence.  I did not write this article to justify adopting a victim mentality because if you adopt that mentality then you will only invite more victimization into your life.   Instead I wrote it to free you from any self-imposed guilt you may hold over your child support feelings.  Next time you are attacked or accused you will have the moral high-ground.   So, accept the present moment as it is holding no feelings of guilt nor victimization and instead focus on productive ways to increase your freedom and enjoy your life.   If we can spread this new vision of child support throughout society then things will change for everyone.

Conclusion

     All court-ordered child support is unjust and no father should feel that the support payments are a moral or legitimate obligation.   No one should be judged for not paying or not wanting to pay.   Those who seek to collect support on a non-voluntary basis are committing acts of aggression stealing both custody and money at gunpoint from the other parent.  Despite the obvious injustice, do not give in to the victim mentality and instead spread the vision for fair judgments and peaceful cooperation.
