The Libertarian Utopia 

The most simplistic description of a libertarian utopia is a peaceful well ordered society without a government that can use the threat of violence to enforce laws.   Few would accept the notion that the simple absence of government is sufficient.  A society ruled by gangs and warlords after a dystopian collapse of former governments would not qualify.   

The heart of a libertarian utopia is a society that effectively protects life, liberty, and property for all against all.   This means that a system for resolving disputes over property rights, discouraging violence, encouraging restitution, and achieving justice is a necessary cornerstone of society.

Many of these systems have been discussed in the past by prominent libertarian thinkers.  It usually boils down to hiring an insurance company to protect your property, a security company to protect your person, and an arbitration company to resolve disputes.   We have all of these things today.  Renters insurance protects your property in the event of theft.   Security companies monitor your home and notify police.  Private body guards protect the rich and famous.  There are many self defense products on the market from guns to pepper spray to self defense courses.   Arbitration firms already resolve more disputes than the government courts every single day.

The problem we face is that you cannot insure against government theft, you cannot hire a body guard to protect against government thugs, and you cannot use arbitration to resolve disputes with the government.

The free market needs to produce a product or service that is so effective at protecting life, liberty, and property that it can operate today and gradually reduce and eliminate the threat of government aggression.  This will be the focus of this blog.
