						<p>My father and I were discussing BitShares one evening (fall 2013) and I was trying to describe how BitShares is different from an altcoin.   I used an analogy that described BitShares as a crypto-equity in a decentralized bank and exchange called BitShares.  The shareholders of the bank are those who own bitshares (BTS).   I then went on to explain how this decentralized bank can create dollars just like their centralized counterparts.  I posted a variation of this article on Lets Talk Bitcoin and it launched the concept of a DAC (<strong>D</strong>ecentralized <strong>A</strong>utonomous <strong>C</strong>orporation ).   </p>

<p>Since then legal worry worts have relabeled the concept of a DAC into DAOs (Organizations)  or simply DAs (Distributed Applications).  I have personal chosen to use many different variations on the DAC acronym to help communicate the many different perspectives that are possible and bring added clarity and precision to the term.   I now use Distributed Automated <strong>C</strong>ompany, <strong>C</strong>ommunity, <strong>C</strong>oop, <strong>C</strong>ountry, or <strong>C</strong>urrency depending on the situation.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-modern-banking">Overview of Modern Banking</h2>

<p>All banks these days operate on what I like to call a <em>fictional</em> reserve basis.  When you approach the bank for a loan to buy a house, the bank creates new dollars from thin air backed by your collateralized promise to pay back the loan.  In this case, your house is the collateral and the bank may call your loan and foreclose if you stop making the required payments or if the value of the house falls too much.   When you pay off your loan the dollars are destroyed and the bank keeps the interest payments and the lean is removed from your house.   The key thing to remember here is that these dollars are nothing more than an IOU from the bank.   People trust the value of the IOUs because they trust the bank to honor their promise to pay a dollars worth of value.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/GoldCoinDollar.png" />
</center>

<p>Lets step back one step further and consider that a dollar use to be defined as  412.5 grains of 99.9% pure silver.   When you received a bank note it was a promise to pay  one dollar worth of gold and the law defined the fixed ratio of gold to silver required to give the bank note a tie to the real world.</p>

<p>As you can see the promise to pay is denominated in dollars which are defined as a weight in silver, and yet what is paid out upon redemption is gold.   This example demonstrates that a dollar is just an arbitrary label assigned to a certain amount of value.  Just like you could have a dollar of silver or a dollar of gold, you could also have a dollar of corn, a dollar of oil, or a dollar of anything including a dollar of bitcoin!   When the United States left the gold standard entirely the dollar began to float against all other goods and services and now has value for its own sake even though it is no longer price-fixed against gold or silver.  The dollar is nothing more than an arbitrary measure of value and is still redeemable for $1 worth of silver at the current market price (not the price fixed 412.5 grains of silver).</p>

<h2 id="bitshares-as-a-dac">BitShares as a DAC</h2>

<p>Lets go back to the world of decentralized digital companies and consider how a decentralized bank can lend dollars into existence just like their centralized counterparts.   First the bank must identify someone who would like to borrow dollars. The borrower posts the collateral that backs the value of the dollars.    Just like real banks,  BitShares requires collateral for the loan and the only collateral BitShares has the ability to foreclose upon is its own equity, BTS.  It is easier to understand the lending analogy if you consider a home equity loan taken out against a house you already own free and clear.  In normal economic conditions, a Bank will never loan you an amount more than 80% of the value of your house.  If your house is worth $100,000 the most you can borrow in $80,000.   In the case of BitShares if you have $100,000 worth of BTS, the most you can borrow is $33,333.  This is far more conservative than banks, especially considering the collateral (BTS) is far more liquid and fungible than a one-of-a-kind house.</p>

<p>BitUSD is the equivalent of the old bank notes that promised to pay $1 worth of value on demand.  In the case of the old bank notes, this value was denominated in gold or silver.  In the case of the BitShares this value is $1 worth of equity, aka BTS.   BitShares can almost always make good on this promise because when someone comes to redeem a note and is unable to sell it on the market directly the value of the BitUSD in terms of BTS will rise until the decentralized bank has the authority to call a loan and use the collateral to repurchase the BitUSD.  </p>

<p>Most people understand why someone would borrow money to buy a house, but why would someone mortgage their BitShares for BitUSD?   The reason someone would borrow BitUSD is so they could sell it and take what is called a short position.  A short position is a speculative bet that BitUSD will go down in value relative to BTS.  If the value does go down then the speculator can repurchase the BitUSD for fewer BTS in the future and then pay off the loan while pocketing a nice profit.  This is how speculators on Wall Street make money when stocks go down: they borrow the stock, sell it for $100, and then repurchase it later for $50 and return the stock while making a $50 profit. </p>

<h2 id="dividends--interest-payments">Dividends &amp; Interest Payments</h2>
<p>All banks attempt to operate for a profit and therefore charge interest on loans along with transaction fees and inactivity fees.  The bank profits are the distributed to the shareholders as dividends.  In the case of the BitShares there are also transaction fees, registration fees, margin-call fees, etc. and the profits that result from charging these fees are paid to the shareholders via a stock buyback.</p>

<p>When someone wishes to borrow BitUSD from the bank they do not get to borrow this money interest-free.  Instead they pay interest based upon the market demand for borrowing USD.  The more people that want to borrow BitUSD relative to the people wanting to lend (buy) it the higher the interest rate shorts will pay.  In practice the interest rate on BitUSD will be proportional to the short term growth expectations of BTS and the relative demand for leverage.</p>

<p>It is through this explanation of BitShares that the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Company was born and a new take on the nature of Bitcoin as a decentralized autonomous company rather than just a crypto-currency came to be.</p>

<h2 id="recent-developments">Recent Developments</h2>

<p>When this article was originally written (Fall 2013) the concept of a DAC was very young.  Since that time the analogy has been expanded upon and the metaphor has lead to major advancements in the crypto currency space including: Delegated Proof of Stake which eliminated mining and enabled dilution as a means to permanently fund the growth and development of decentralized businesses.  </p>

<p>Max Wright in is book <a href="/article/2014/12/20/BitShares-101.html">BitShares 101</a> goes into much greater detail in describing DACs as it relates to what BitShares is today. In his book he describes how Bitcoin is a DAC and provides great detail about the power of Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS).  I highly recommend you check it out.   </p>

						<p>Max Wright has just published the first e-book about BitShares: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BitShares-101-Generation-Currencies-Decentralized-ebook/dp/B00QUIWHR0/">“BitShares 101”</a>.  For a long time 
the BitShares community has needed a introductory guide for the average man. Max
has done an amazing job taking a complex subject and condensing it down into 
something easily understood.  His writing style is very conversational and easy
to follow.</p>

<p>In this ~59 page book you will find clear explanations of things such as
Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs).  An overview of <a href="/update/2014/12/18/What-is-BitShares.html">BitShares</a> and
<a href="/article/2014/12/18/What-are-BitShares-Market-Pegged-Assets.html">BitAssets</a> is provided
that takes a slightly different approach at describing BitShares than I did in
my post on <a href="/update/2014/12/18/What-is-BitShares.html">“What is BitShares?”</a>.  In his
approach he describes BitShares using the company metaphor.  This is perhaps
the most useful approach to understanding BitShares from the perspective of an
investor. </p>

<p>If you want to understand the value proposition of BitShares this is the book for you. If
want to understand the philosophy of BitShares then my blog is the place for you.</p>

<p>It is currently available for $0.99 on Amazon Kindle.  Max is selling the book for
the sole purpose of getting free advertising on the Amazon best sellers list for 
various categories.   Even if you already know everything there is to know about
BitShares I highly recommend you buy the book as a way of supporting our community and
providing Max with a tip for the excellent work has produced.</p>

<h2 id="bitsharestv">BitShares.TV</h2>

<p>For those of you who don’t know, Max has also launched a video at <a href="http://bitshares.tv">BitShares.TV</a> covering 
BitShares related topics.  His video blog is the analog of my written blog. </p>

						<p>Whether we like it or not the mob ultimately runs society.  Individual property rights mean nothing in a riot.   If public opinion turns against something nothing can resist it for long, not even the most oppressive governments.  A libertarian utopia is the result of changing public opinion and maintaining public support for universal application of the <a href="/article/2014/12/16/Golden-Principle.html">Golden Principle</a> without exception. If you haven’t read my post on the Golden Principle I recommend you check it out.     </p>

<p>Unfortunately most people do not form their opinion based upon facts and reason, but instead defer to the opinions of others.  Each and every day people make decisions based upon what they think other people think.   Style, language, morals, religion, politics, and just about everything are heavily influenced by other peoples opinions.   When in doubt most people defer to public opinion over their own opinion and this is the heart of democracy.</p>

<p>Billions of dollars are spent every single year in an effort to shape and then measure the aggregate opinion of the entire population on politics alone.   There is an entire field of study dedicated to the manipulation of pubic opinion for profit.</p>

<p>Some of the more sophisticated techniques of manipulating opinion is by corrupting the measuring and reporting process.   If you can control the major media outlets and continuously show support of a minority opinion over a majority opinion then people will come to believe that the minority opinion is the majority opinion.   This can either be subtle or overt.  </p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most overt attempts to manipulate public opinion is the corruption of “scientific polling” prior to elections or the elections themselves.   As a result of publishing these scientific polls people conclude that some candidates are unelectable while others are extremely popular even if they are not.  If you can manipulate an election then you can change the very constitution of a society while facing limited opposition. </p>

<p>No one likes to be a minority that stands out against the majority.  They will often publicly support the majority opinion even if they privately object.  This creates a self reinforcing cycle that results in the quiet suffering and repression of the majority. </p>

<p>If we are to achieve a libertarian utopia it becomes critical that the market produce an actuate and fully trustworthy measurement of the aggregate opinion.   A private, incorruptible, continuous polling of the population would provide a means for people to feel safe communicating their desire to change the way society operates.  </p>

<p>Fortunately with the combination of the internet and modern cryptography we now have the tools necessary to produce a nearly incorruptible anonymous polling solution.   </p>

						<p>Creating a free society is the combined result of individuals giving each other freedom.  You have heard it said, “give, and ye shall receive”, this is the foundation of a free society.

						<p>Answering the question “What is BitShares?” has been one of the most difficult challenges I have faced.  BitShares is so many things to different people and there are a thousand different ways of understanding what BitShares is.  This post will tell you what BitShares is to me, its founder.  Before getting into the long-answer to this question, let me give you the executive summary.   BitShares is one of the most important tools that any community can use to secure their freedom; an idea whose time has come. After reading this post I bet you will agree.</p>

						<p>BitShares market pegged assets are a new type of freely traded digital asset whose value is meant to track the value of a conventional asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  What makes market pegged assets unique is that they are free from counter party risk.  BitShares uses an advanced decentralized consensus ledger that takes some cues from Bitcoin.  While Bitcoin has demonstrated many useful properties as a currency, its price volatility makes it risky to hold and difficult to use for everyday pricing and payments.  A currency with the properties and advantages of Bitcoin that maintains price parity with a globally adopted currency such as the US dollar has high utility for convenient and censorship resistant commerce.  This paper will explain how market pegged assets including “BitUSD” (intended to track the value of the US dollar) achieve price parity while minimizing risk to holders.</p>
