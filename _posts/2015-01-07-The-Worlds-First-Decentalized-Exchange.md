The centralized exchanges the world has known throughout history have proven unreliable and
untrustworthy time and again.  Whether it is MF Global, Mt. Gox, or BitStamp we have seen 
every all of the perils of allowing a 3rd party to hold your money. It doesn't matter how
big they are or how many auditors, regulators, or insurers are involved every kind of fraud, 
abuse, and theft occurs on a daily basis.  It is time for a change. Today I would like to
introduce the benefits you get by using the worlds first fully decentralized exchange, BitShares.

## Decentralized

Decentralization gives BitShares robustness against failure.  When a centralized exchange is
compromised millions of dollars and thousands of users are impacted all at once.  In a decentralized
system any attack or failure impacts only a single user and their funds.   Users are in control
of their own security which can potentially be much better than any centralized entity.

There is a fixed cost associated with attempting to hack an exchange vs an individual user.  The difference
is the size of the reward.  If you place a multi-million dollar bounty on attacking a specific exchange,
then you can expect a lot more effort to be put into compromising that exchange than would be put into
attacking your individual account. 

Within a given company there are many people whom have access to the funds.   You may have heard the 
expression that "Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead", well all exchanges end up 
depending upon multiple people who share the responsibility of guarding the funds.  If any one of them 
is compromised then everyones funds are at risk.  In this respect being individually responsible for maintaining 
your own secrets can be much more secure than any multi-signature system.   

## Fast, but not *too* fast  
With BitShares your trades execute in seconds, just like any centralized website interface.  Unlike centralized
exchanges there can be no high frequency trading, front running, or hidden orders.  This puts all traders on
a level playing field. 

On Wall Street traders go to great length to get as physically close to the exchange as possible because 
their trading bots are making decisions so fast that the speed of light becomes a real limitation. A
decentralized exchange is location neutral, everyone has an equal opportunity.

   Up to 3 times the reserves of traditional 
   exchanges without any counter-party risk.
