title:  "NuBits is structured like a Ponzi Scheme"

I am not one to throw around the term Ponzi scheme loosely.  After all just about every crypto project has been called a Ponzi scheme at some point.   Just because early adopters get rich doesn’t make something a Ponzi, what matters is the structure and financial soundness of the investment opportunity.  [NuBits](https://nubits.com/) is a crypto currency that has emerged from the [Peercoin community](http://peercointalk.org) which aims to peg its value to the dollar.  It has the appearance of being very successful because of high volumes, tight spreads and an outstanding supply of NuBits worth over $2 million.    From the outside one may even get the impression that NuBits is better than [BitUSD]({% post_url 2014-12-18-What-are-BitShares-Market-Pegged-Assets %}) at maintaining a peg to the dollar.   All Ponzi schemes start out looking like solid investments until one day they collapse.  What is most fascinating about the NuBits Ponzi is that it currently is promising a return of 0%!!! This must be some kind of first in Ponzi history.

Before going any further I would like to clarify that I have no evidence to suggest the people behind NuBits and NuShares have intent to defraud.  This article merely aims to highlight the structural problems with NuBits as I see them.  Some people have suggested that I should not use the phrase "Ponzi Scheme" because it could be offensive, but that would merely make me complicit and harm those who read this blog.  Until new information surfaces that proves that NuBits has at least 100% reserve which are secure against theft, fraud, or misappropriation then I will maintain the fully objective, non-FUD, opinion that a NuBit is at best an unsecured IOU from unknown issuers.  It only becomes a Ponzi scheme once NuBits is forced to print new NuBits to pay interest on old NuBits.  They are not currently doing this, but due to the fractional reserve, naked-shorting that I believe is being  practiced it is inevitable.  Even Ponzi started out with honest intentions. 

It is my sincere hope that the fans of NuBits can identify and clarify any misunderstandings in this post.  If you have identified the secret to high-liquidity, low-risk, pegged crypto-currencies then it is something I want to understand and share with my readers.  

## What is a Ponzi Scheme?

I am going to start with a clear definition of a Ponzi according to Wikipedia:

>  A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or organization, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the operator.

Some people take issue with the term *fraudulent* because it implies intent.  Like I said above, I do not know the *intent* of the NuBits founders.  It is not uncommon for people to intentionally and transparently create a Ponzi scheme for entertainment and gambling purposes.  While being transparent or ignorant about the nature your scheme removes the element of fraud, it does not change the structure of the scheme. For the purposes of this article I only care about the financial structure and not the intent of the founders.   

Now that we have a definition of a Ponzi scheme, lets review NuBits and see if it uses new capital to pay a return to original investors.  

## Creating NuBits

NuBits can be created in any amount at any time provided the NuShareholders vote to approve the issuance.  The new NuBits are then given to a custodian whom is trusted to run a market bot designed to keep the peg.   As demand for NuBits increases these custodians are granted additional NuBits in order to suppress the price.   

The real challenge is what happens when demand for NuBits decreases.  In other words, what happens when investors want to sell?   

The NuShareholders vote on an interest rate that will be paid to NuBits holders whom volunteer to *park* their NuBits for a defined period of time.  The interest is paid by the issuance of *new* NuBits.   In other words, parked NuBits get a return paid from future investors.  If there are no future investors then the interest rate would go to infinity and the entire dollar peg would break down.   This is the classic, text-book, definition of a Ponzi Scheme. 

## Market Maker Bots

All NuBits are sold into circulation from a handful of anonymous custodians providing liquidity.  These custodians pocket $1 of BTC for each NuBit they sell.   In the short term they have financial incentive to redeem NuBits for $1.  Over time people start to trust that a NuBit will always been redeemable for $1 and thus demand for NuBits grows.   The larger the demand for NuBits the more money that is made by the custodians elected by NuShareholders.  This is how all confidence games work.

One thing that needs to be pointed out is that these custodians have no legal obligation to buy back the NuBits they have sold.  In fact, chances are that they are unable to buy back all of the NuBits they have sold.  It would become very obvious that NuBits are practicing fractional reserve *if* they had any transparency; unfortunately, there is little transparency on the total reserves held by the bots.

## The Likely Insolvency of NuBit Custodians 

Lets stop to consider the fact that all NuBits are being traded against crypto currencies on various exchanges.  Every NuBit that was sold for $1 worth of BTC transfers BTC to a custodian.   Since NuBits launched Bitcoin has fallen 50% (from $500 to $250).  Unless the custodian liquidated to real USD they now have 50% of the capital required to buy back the NuBits.  A custodian has little financial incentive to eat the 50% loss in Bitcoin price in the event there is a run on NuBits.     

I suspect that the primary motivation for becoming a NuBits custodian is to get free leverage on Bitcoin.  They *naked-sell* a dollar worth of Bitcoin and promise to buy it back in the future.  The NuBits holder is trusting their promise to buy it back.  As long as you are betting on BTC going up in value then the NuBits custodians can continue to hold the peg and increase their leverage.  

What makes NuBits interesting is that it isn’t even an IOU.  It is sold as an obligation free token where the buyers have “faith” that the custodians will continue to buy a NuBit at $1.  The custodians are working very hard to build that confidence in the market by behaving as expected.  

When NuBits custodians need to raise capital they offer to start paying interest.  They will pay interest to delay redemption requests until Bitcoin’s price can rise.   This is very much like a bank that faces insolvency and thus offers to pay interest to attract new depositors and pay off old depositors.     

I think a more accurate perspective on the interest paid to NuBits holders is the interest paid on the US national debt.  The US government has no realistic means of ever paying off the debt, yet people still allow them to borrow the money necessary to pay interest on the money they already borrowed.   

Even if the NuBit custodians have the best of intentions, we know from their trading volume that they keep a large quantity of BTC on the exchanges.  Therefore, we know they have lost 50% of their capital held as BTC.   If an exchange were to be hacked or compromised then the NuBit custodians would lose a large amount of their capital making them instantly insolvent and unable to peg NuBits to USD.

We can conclude from this that in a declining crypto-currency bear market that the NuBits custodians must be practicing fractional reserves and are therefore insolvent.

## Prediction for NuBits 

The NuBits Ponzi scheme will eventually collapse unless the Bitcoin price can recover before there is a run on NuBits.   It will probably continue to maintain a strong peg right up until the day it collapses.   When it does collapse it will be sudden and the NuBit holder will get nothing. 

## A Quick Comparison to BitUSD 
Sometimes it is helpful to have a point of reference.   BitUSD is also sold into existence, but unlike NuBits where the issuer provides no capital and starts out with at best 100% reserve, a BitUSD short seller provides 2x the capital and starts out with 300% reserve.   Unlike the NuBits custodian, the BitUSD short seller is forced to cover their position while they still have 200% reserves.   Unlike NuBits, BitUSD reserves are fully audit-able and are not held on exchanges that could be compromised.   Unlike NuBits, BitUSD still has 225% reserves even after the huge fall in the price of all crypto currencies in the past month.   Unlike NuBits which currently pays 0%, all BitUSD is currently paying an estimated yield over 1%.   Unlike NuBits, all BitUSD can be covered and the supply can return to 0.  Unlike NuBits, no one can vote to increase the BitUSD supply.
