Our monetary system is built on a web of debt and deception.  Banks and the governments that charter them are in complete control of our financial lives.  Without their permission we cannot buy or sell online.   Without notice our bank accounts can be stolen with little resource.  Even if you avoid banks, the governments of the world are inflating money supply and steeling your wealth from your mattress and paycheck.   Even honest companies that hold 100% reserves and attempt to provide an alternative monetary system are attacked by governments and have proven they are not viable alternatives.   This is the problem we all face.  This is what Bitcoin tries to solve.

In my opinion, the Bitcoin community has lost track of the problem and is now enamored with their solution and solving problems with the Bitcoin solution.    Debates surface about whether or not something is decentralized, trust-free, secure, etc.   Proof of work is facing off against Proof of Stake and the various Proof of Stake solutions are fighting among themselves for supremacy.  

Lost in the middle of these debates is whether or not we have solved the original problem.  There are a dozen ways to build a house and all of them provide adequate shelter.  Some are nicer than others, but they all solve the problem.  What I am witnessing in the Bitcoin ecosystem is that people are fighting over what color to paint the walls and how to layout the floor plan while rain is coming through the roof.   We set out to build a shelter from the financial storm all around us and lost track of our goal along the way.

The real problem we face in society is debt.  In the early days you could own gold or silver as money and spend it to buy your food, shelter and clothing.  This gold and silver were the only forms of money that were not simultaneously someone else liability (aka debt).   Until Bitcoin all digital assets were a form of debt managed on a database within the banks.  Bitcoin introduced us to the first debt-free digital asset that was fungible, divisible, and had value.   This is how Bitcoin actually solved the real problem.

The question that remains is what parts of Bitcoin are necessary to creating a debt-free digital asset and what parts are superfluous?     I contend there is only one thing that is necessary: an irreversible, globally recognized, uncensorable, official public record that anyone may contribute to.   Everything else is just decoration. Proof of work, P2P, and the notion of decentralization are red herrings.  

Is Bitcoin irreversible?  Technically No.  At the protocol level anyone at any time can do enough work to create an alternative history.  In the Bitcoin sphere the desire for “objective purity” means that consensus is arrived at without thinking.  The math alone determines the truth.  
Practically speaking, Bitcoin aims to make it difficult to reverse.  The cost to brute force reverse the Bitcoin network is about $30,000 per hour of reversal.

Is Bitcoin uncensorable?  Technically No.  If about a dozen people got together they could block any transaction they like.   These people are self selected and purchased their right to control what transactions get included into blocks.   The total cost to maintain this right is about $30,000 per hour.   Once again, it is difficult but not impossible to censor Bitcoin.  

What we can see from this is that Bitcoin has established that a perfect solution is not necessary provided it is sufficiently difficult to censor or reverse a transaction.   

Proof of Stake systems also solve the problem of creating an irreversible and uncensorable global public ledger.   Depending upon your approach you will get varying amount of speed, but most proof of stake approaches end up requiring a significant amount of capital to attack when they are the size of Bitcoin.   Proof of Stake isn’t perfect.  In practice, all proof of stake networks can be compromised by owning as little as 15% of the stake because not all stakeholders contribute to the network security.   This would total $450 million dollars worth of capital at Bitcoin’s valuation which is enough money to fund a 51% attack on Bitcoin for 2 years straight. 
Like Bitcoin, most proof of stake systems are ultimately controlled by just a few dozen individuals due to the distribution of wealth.   

Can Proof of Stake be reversed?   Under most systems it can be because like Bitcoin they rely almost entirely on the math.   Someone with a large stake can potentially produce two alternative chains and the longest chain is automatically declared official.  

Under Delegated Proof of Stake and Ripple style consensus there are no long term forks and the code marches forward.  They rely on the fact that the “public record” is irreversible.  Private alternative records are ignored regardless of how long or otherwise valid the record is.  All that is necessary is for enough nodes to stay connected at all times so as to have no dispute over what is public.   This can be verified by having a large enough number of trusted people “sign off” on having seen the record. 

## The Problem is Debt, not Trust 

Each and every day we do business with people on the basis of trust.  No one believes that your local grocery store is “too centralized” nor do they require cryptographic proof on every email.   Operating a business in public, for profit, is enough for almost every kind of transaction.  Centralization isn’t the problem.   The problem is debt.  

Once you introduce debt then even the most trustworthy individual has the potential to default.  A trustworthy bank with 100% reserves and a public ledger with continuous public audits can be shutdown by the government or robbed by thieves.   Debt is always at risk of default even by trustworthy individuals.  

It just so happens that most debt is centralized in large banks and financial institutions.  The problem isn’t the centralization, it is the debt.   After all, Apple is a large centralized company that manages more money than most financial institutions but you never see the same issues with Apple that you do with banks.   This is because Apple never puts itself in the position of owing millions of people money.   Every trade is a “value-for-value” immediate trade.  After the trade, there is no significant ongoing liability.

We all implicitly trust a half dozen miners or perhaps 50 or so large stake holders under proof of stake.   These people can be trusted and they do not owe us money.   They gain very little by attempting to rob us and generally speaking they have little to gain and much to lose by attempting to rob us. 

For all practical purposes a single company could host a blockchain and produce 100% of all blocks so long as all submitted transactions were public and everyone had a copy of the blockchain.   We could trust this company because any attempt at fraud would be detectable and unambiguous.   The probability of getting caught is near 100% thus few would dare violate the public trust.     In the event that the trust was violated, the cost of switching to another company to manage the public ledger would be relatively low.

There is only one reason that a blockchain needs “decentralization” and that is to provide seamless transition in the event of failure.  Perhaps what is really required is a distributed system with sufficient redundancies.   A government cannot erase the public record nor easily prevent any and all communication between people.   If they took down the one and only company managing the public ledger, a new company could sprout up overnight in another jurisdiction and take over.   It may result in some downtime and a slight disruption, but you can be sure that everyones property rights as documented in the public ledger would still be in tact.

## Time to Refocus 

There are many innovations going on in the crypto-currency world today, but most of them have lost sight of the problem being solved and instead aim to produce solutions without a problem.  There has been tremendous effort put into creating smart contracts and decentralized exchanges.   Light wallets are being built with the assumption that *no one can be trusted* and everything is being over-engineered to eliminate all trust at great expense and for little gain.   Ripple & Nxt both provide exchanges that allow users to issue their own assets and usually these assets take the form of an IOU.  They are not solving the debt issue.  

Moving the existing banking system from internal databases to public blockchains will not solve the problem.  Having a decentralize exchange dealing entirely in debt instruments leaves the real wealth in the hands of the same people that control it today.    

The current banking system can easily adopt a fully centralized “invite only” ledger to solve all of their “intra-bank-settlement” issues.   Ripple happens to be a relatively good solution, but is clearly burdened by unnecessary decentralization and overly complex consensus considering how it is being used. 

What no one is focusing on is how to create trust-free digital assets pegged to the value of real world assets.   What we need is digital gold that is not someone else’s liability.   This is what BitShares is trying to solve.  

Sure we provide one of the most decentralized, distributed, high speed, and democratic solutions on the market.  But it isn’t our speed or consensus algorithm that truly matters, it is our trust free 300% reserve BitAsset system.   We have created a virtual debt instrument who's collateral is held in a manner that cannot be seized nor stolen.  A system that can work with many different consensus algorithms or even on a fully centralized server.    

So next time you look at an alt-coin or Bitcoin 2.0 solution remind yourself what really matters and what is noise.  Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake is not critical to the core product, though one clearly has a lot more costs than the other.   Because it is not critical there is no reason to adopt something that is unnecessarily expensive.   Delegated Proof of Stake vs the alternatives are not critical.  Because they are not critical there is no reason to adopt anything slower than DPOS.

It is time to set aside the implementation details and focus on the actual content of our irreversible public ledgers.   














     






Since Bitcoin was launched there have been many people discussing all of the problems that Bitcoin supposedly solves.   Academics like to discuss the Byzantine generals problem while others talk about how it creates a trust-free currency.   There are many parts to Bitcoin each of which is solving a slightly different problem.   These parts include: proof of work, p2p network, public ledger, a blockchain, and cryptography.   The combination of these parts creates what we know as Bitcoin.    The question is, what has Bitcoin really solved and what parts of Bitcoin are actually irrelevant to the problem being solved?  In other words, what parts of Bitcoin are there to solve side issues rather than the main issue?

Perhaps one of the most frequently used words in the Bitcoin ecosystem is *decentralization*.  If something isn’t decentralized then it is automatically distrusted.    This begs the question, what problem does decentralization really solve?   Does decentralization solve the trust issue or is that solved by something else?

Other people discuss proof of work as being critical to solving the problem.   Does proof of work create a currency or solve trust issues?   What problem does proof of work really solve and is that problem essential to creating a trust-free currency?

Still others talk about p2p networks being critical to solving the problem of a trust-free currency.  The argument is that without a p2p
