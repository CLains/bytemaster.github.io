Answering the question "What is BitShares?" has been one of the most difficult challenges I have faced.  BitShares is so many things to different people and there are a thousand different ways of understanding what BitShares is.  This post will tell you what BitShares is to me, its founder.  Before getting into the long-answer to this question, let me give you the executive summary.   BitShares is one of the most important tools that any community can use to secure their freedom.  BitShares is an idea whose time has come. After reading this post I bet you will agree.

There are many different layers at which we can understand BitShares.  Each layer has its own benefit and usefulness. 

![BitShares is like an Onion](/img/BitSharesIsLikeAnOnion.jpg)


At its most inner layer, **BitShares is software**.  To be more specific, BitShares is a distributed multi-user database with update permissions managed by a defined set of rules and public key cryptography.   At this level it isn't very interesting to most people, but is still very important.  Software is open source, easily copied and modified, and most importantly protected by free speech.  This means that almost nothing can stop BitShares at this layer short of a global event that destroys almost all digital data.  At one point governments attempted to regulate cryptographic software as a weapon and impose export controls.  Governments lost that battle long ago and no longer attempt to regulate or control the spread of free software.  In the case of BitShares the software is in the [Public Domain](update/2014/12/17/Why-Public-Domain.html).

Moving up a layer, **BitShares is a network**.  A network of computers owned by individuals all over the world run the BitShares software and keep their databases synchronized according to the rules defined by the software.  The BitShares network can survive as long as there are at least two computers that can communicate with each other over the internet.  This network of distributed computers ensures that the database is robust against failure.  Every single computer on the network maintains a full copy of the database which means no one can change the public record.  This immutable public record becomes the foundation of higher layers.

**BitShares is a Ledger**.  A ledger is a database containing account balances and transfers among them.  Every bank, company, and organization that deals in financial matters has a ledger that tracks who owns what.   The BitShares ledger is very robust because it is built on the prior two layers: highly distributed network, that is fully transparent, and secured by the latest cryptography.   

Compare this to ledgers in use all around the world today.  Ledgers based upon paper can be lost, stolen, modified, burned, or miscalculated.  Digital ledgers managed by software such as Quick Books or Quicken are centrally managed, can be updated, changed, back dated, corrupted or otherwise misused.  Advanced ledgers such as is in use by our banking system are still subject to human error, lack transparency, are only backed up a hand full of places and often times are internally inconsistent.  Just ask the owners of MF Global where the depositors funds went?  Ask any of the big banks who really owns the gold and how many times the same oz of gold has been used as collateral.  The ledgers in use today around the world are fundamentally broken when it comes to reliably tracking property rights.  How do we know they are broken? Have you ever heard of cooking the books?  That is what todays ledgers allow and the only protection we have is a manual audit which quickly become impossible for the average person to do. 

**BitShares is a Company**.  Companies are merely a ledger tracking joint ownership in a common venture.  Companies issue stock which is nothing more than a ledger entry tracking what percent of the company each individual owns.  Companies are managed by a board of directors which is elected by the shareholders, the votes of which are logged in the companies ledger. Companies have a business model that hopes to earn profit for the shareholders and they maintain detailed records of all business transactions which, in theory, can be audited by the shareholders to ensure management isn't embezzling money. 

In the case of BitShares, the database tracks ownership of shares known as BTS.  Each share can vote for 110 delegates, the top 101 delegates by vote become responsible for running the software and maintaining the network as well as performing other tasks for which they are paid by the shareholders.  BitShares is a company in the business of processing transactions for a fee and the profits from this business are shared with the shareholders via stock buybacks. 

**BitShares is an Exchange**.  The New York Stock exchange is a company, that maintains a ledger, that tracks ownership of stock and debt issued by other companies. It earns money from transaction fees and has its own stock as well.   Like the New York Stock exchange, BitShares allows people to issue their stock or debt to be tracked and traded on its distributed ledger.  

**BitShares is a Bank**.  Banks are companies, that maintain a ledger, that tracks debt collateralized by other assets such as housing.  This debt is the money used around the world is is denominated in dollars, euros, yuan, etc.  Banks earn income by charging interest to the borrowers and attract capital by paying interest to depositors.  BitShares creates dollar denominated debt collateralized by BTS.  This dollar denominated debt is a [BitAsset](/article/2014/12/18/What-are-BitShares-Market-Pegged-Assets.html)known as BitUSD.  BitShares supports any number of BitAssets including BitGold, BitSilver, BitOil, etc.  Whereas normal banks practice the unsustainable business of fractional reserve banking, BitShares uses at least 200% reserve and is often over 300% reserve.  Whereas normal banks use illiquid assets to back (collateralize) debt payable on demand, BitShares uses highly liquid BTS as collateral.   Whereas normal banks are bailed out by tax payers, BitShares depositors have direct claim on the collateral.   

Overall BitShares is better banking.

**BitShares is a Currency**.  Anything can be used as money in the right circumstances.  Gold, silver, giant stones, paper, debt, and cigarettes have all been used as money.  The rich and powerful have often used bearer shares (paper stock certificates) as a form of money.  In the case of BitShares there are many different assets that can be used as money including, BTS, BitUSD, BitGold, and BitSilver.   All of these assets have the property of being fungible, divisible, transportable, and impossible to counterfeit.  

I have previously said that the best money is like a Flux Capacitor.  It can move value though time and space as quickly as possible with minimal loss.  Gold is great at moving value though time as demonstrated by the fact that gold mined 1000 years ago is still worth something today.  Fiat currencies produced by governments have a shelf life of less than 100 years during which they slowly lose all of their value.  Unfortunately gold and paper money are not very efficient at moving value through space.  It is very time consuming and expensive.

Bank deposits are very efficient at moving value through space via wire transfers, but they are still expensive and relatively slow (days). Bank deposits can also lose all of their value far more often than paper dollars because banks regularly go bankrupt.
