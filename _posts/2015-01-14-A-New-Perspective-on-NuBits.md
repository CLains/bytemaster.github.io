My [last article]({% post_url 2015-01-13-NuBits-is-a-Ponzi-Scheme %}) on NuBits and NuShares  received a bit of criticism for using the term “Ponzi Scheme” and accusations were made that I didn’t fully understand how NuBits and NuShares work.  I would like to take a moment to offer a new perspective on NuBits that will help provide a better understanding of the risks and rewards associated with participating in either NuShares or NuBits without using the Ponzi Scheme perspective. 

As the [father of the DAC metaphor]({% post_url 2014-12-20-BitShares-as-a-Bank %}), I would like to view NuShares and NuBits through the lens of a decentralized company.   In this case imagine a group of wealthy individuals got together to form a company called “Nu”.   These individuals allocate each other NuShares based upon their own capital contributions to the company.  

The purpose for forming a company is to make money and thus all companies need a business plan.   In the case of Nu, I suspect their business plan involves borrowing money to invest in Bitcoin and then making money as a market maker in their own bonds.    The NuShareholders recognized that their bonds would be worth more if they had all the properties of a crypto-currency and thus they branded their bonds NuBits.  

After doing the necessary engineering work to implement their blockchain accounting software, the Nu company was ready to open for business.    Since they launched they have sold over $2 million worth of 0% interest bonds.  The proceeds of these bonds where distributed among various custodians approved by the NuShareholders.   These custodians can be viewed as the treasurer of a traditional company.

As a company they have assets and liabilities on their balance sheet.  In this case, the NuBits represents the liability and the assets are the crypto currency they received for the dollars they borrowed.   I am sure their portfolio contains a mix of assets.  

They have maintained a relatively high volume of trade on the order of over $1 million dollars per day.  Their spread has been very thin to nonexistent on their market making activities with most of their spread being eaten up in trading fees of the various exchanges.  It would be very interesting to know how much they are making on this spread, but lets assume $1,000 per day or about $360,000 per year.   Note this is just a SWAG (scientific wild ass guess). 

Mean while their crypto-currency assets have experienced a capital loss of 50%, also a SWAG.   

So NuShares can be thought of as shares in a company that is $2 million dollars in debt with $1 million in assets and a revenue stream of $360,000 per year from trading fees.   NuBits can be valued based upon the credit-worthiness of the company Nu which is backed by the NuShareholders.  As long as less than $1 million dollars worth of NuBits holders demand payment, then they can maintain the peg.  This is no different than a fractional reserve bank.

What is interesting about NuBits is that they have effectively created a bonds without any real promise to pay.  This fits in with my view of a [contract free society]({% post_url 2014-12-27-The-Benefits-of-A-Contract-Free-Society %}) and helps them significantly from a legal perspective.   The NuShareholders have financial incentive to keep the NuBit peg because their business model is making money on the trading volume while also speculating in the underlying crypto assets. 

While it hasn't been implemented yet, NuShareholders do have the ability to issue new NuShares to raise capital just like any company can.   This means that the bonds of Nu are ultimately backed by the equity in Nu *if* the shareholders approve dilution.  There is no guarantee they will do this and there is no telling how long the voting will take nor whether a default in NuBits will occur first.

Lets think about what this means in terms of a traditional company.  BitStamp earns money from trading volume and has issued debt in the form of BTC and USD deposits.   BitStampUSD is very similar to NuBits in that they are both IOUs from a company backed by shareholders.   BitStampUSD is even tradable on Ripple as a crypto-currency.    If BitStamp were hacked and lacked the assets to pay off their BitStampUSD IOUs then the company could always sell shares to raise capital.  They could also sell bonds and offer to pay interest.    The ability of BitStamp to back their BitStampUSD depends upon their revenue, profits margins, and assets.

So the ability of Nu to back their NuBit  (aka NuUSD) depends upon the exact same considerations as BitStamp to back BitStampUSD.   The difference between these two companies is only the deposit/withdraw fee (spread in NuBits) and the quality of their backing assets (mostly crypto).   

So I think it is fair to say that NuShares probably have more in common with Mt.Gox shares than with BitStamp shares.   Mt.Gox was able to operate for years on fractional reserves as they attempted to make enough money from trading fees to cover losses in their underlying assets.  Likewise, NuBits will probably be able to operate for a long time until the market moves against them.   If they can hold out long enough for their assets to appreciate or can raise enough capital through selling new NuShares then it may go on for a very long time.   

At the end of the day I suspect all NuBits may be backed by NuShares and “worst case” outcome is that your NuBits are converted to NuShares.  

The ability to back a bond with equity is directly related to the liquidity of the equity.  It is not sufficient to look at the NuShares market cap and assume that they can raise $7 million dollars through equity sales.   If we assume that Nu has only $1 million in crypto-assets, then they would need to raise $1 million through the sale of NuShares to pay off their debts.   Dumping $1 million dollars worth of NuShares on the market through new issuance would absolutely crush the NuShare price.  Once again this is only based upon a SWAG regarding their losses on their Bitcoin holdings.

It should be noted that the initial NuShare holders provided some seed money to boot strap the market maker bots.  This seed money can be seen as a form of initial collateral that may be used to cover trading losses.  I am not aware on the details regarding how the initial funds are held and whether or not there is an agreement between "Nu" and the initial investors that their funds are to be used as collateral.   I would love to see a financial statement on the financial health of the "Nu" company.  

Is it a Ponzi Scheme?  That depends upon whether or not you believe fractional reserve banking is a Ponzi Scheme.  Considering Bitcoin was created to put an end to fractional reserve banking, it seems ironic that NuBits claims that it is “The World’s First Stable Digital Currency”.   It seems to me that BitStampUSD on Ripple may be “The World’s First Stable Digital Currency” by NuBits standards.  It certainly isn’t by Bitcoin standards.    

## BitUSD is the Worlds First Stable Crypto Currency

At this point I feel it important to show how BitUSD differs from NuBits.   For starters, every BitUSD is initially backed by $3 worth of reserves held in BTS.   It is automatically covered if the reserves ever fall to $2 per BitUSD.    BitUSD does not grant BitShareholders an unlimited line of credit nor the ability to print new BitUSD without setting aside collateral in advance.    The reserves that back BitUSD are not held in the hands of trusted parties where they are subject to theft by hackers.  The risk of creating new BitUSD is born by individuals and is not socialized among a voting collective.  This means that in a bear market new BitUSD is unlikely to be created because those doing the short selling have to provide the capital to cover their losses in advance.   Lastly, BitUSD actually pays you a positive return simply for holding it.  

Both NuBits and BitUSD are backed by their respective NuShares and BitShares, the difference is in how automated, decentralized, and secure the backing is.   No one can run away with the collateral behind BitUSD, you cannot say the same for NuBits, Mt. Gox, or BitStamp.  

If you don't want BitUSD then in my opinion you should adopt BitStampUSD on Ripple or simply keep your money on your current exchange.  At least the exchanges claim to have 100% reserves and may not even charge you a spread to deposit or withdraw.  Some exchanges even pay you interest.
