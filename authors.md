# Daniel Larimer - Bytemaster

Not all that deep and hidden in his entrepreneurial heart of hearts, Daniel Larimer is a philosopher and a dreamer, identities he readily attests to in discussing an approach to life, study and work that has placed him in the forefront of the Bitcoin world, where he is known within its inner circles as "Father of the DAC." (He originated the idea of the "decentralized autonomous company".)
